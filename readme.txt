1. SQL JOIN
-- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

2. Different Types of SQL JOINs
-- INNER JOIN: Returns records that have matching values in both tables
-- LEFT JOIN: Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
-- RIGHT JOIN: Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
-- FULL JOIN: Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table

3. Subqueries
-- Advantage of Subqueries are their easily readable structure. A disadvantage is that you cannot modify a table and select from the same table within a subquery in the same SQL statement
-- Takes longer than joins
-- Query inside of a Query
